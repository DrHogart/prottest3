<p>
Contains all classes related to model optimization. The <code>RunEstimator</code> interface
contains the method signatures which every optimizer must implement. There is a generic
class with common method implementations: <code>RunEstimatorImpl</code>, but every specific
strategy to optimize the models should extend this class or at least implement the interface.
</p>
<p>
For example, <code>PhyML</code> optimizer has his own implementation <code>PhyMLv3AminoAcidRunEstimator</code>.
In future versions this vertical hierarchy, which could allow extension to support Nucleotide models,
should be transformed following a Bridge Pattern.
